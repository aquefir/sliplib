1. WHAT IS THIS?
-----------------

The Structured Logical Interface, or SLI for short, is a documentation format
created as ADP 2. The name is a backronym from SLI, which was previously
associated with the Slick Makefiles (ADP 4). It is a simple, ASCII-only
structured text format designed to be easy to parse for humans and machines
alike.

- The sli-tool is an ASL licenced C program.
- The sliplib is BSD-2-Clause licenced API header and static library for
  parsing SLI files into an easy-to-process structure.
